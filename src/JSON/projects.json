Lists of these movies are accessible in the hamburger dropdown menu by clicking on the specific catergory title, along with a running count of how many movies are currently included in each list. The User can also filter movies based on genre, release year, and cast, search movies directly in the search bar, and increase or decrease the amount of movies shown on each page. Clicking on a movie card will take the User to a details page where it displays information about the movie such as a synopsis of the film, year of release, cast members, and genre."

Start entering the name of a character and the auto complete functionality will search the Star Wars database for characters who's name includes those letters. Find the character you want the information on and by clicking their name, the app will make a mockAPI call and render a JSON data object displaying various information about the selected character. Anything from age, hair color, and height, to homeworld and how many films the character appeared in. By clicking on the Statistics option you will come to a page where character information is displayed in a table, and the User has checkboxes they can select or deselect to include or remove the category from the table."
