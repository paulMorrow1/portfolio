            I am a Software Developer from Omaha, Nebraska. My Web Development
            journey began in 2021! I was brand new to the Tech Industry, with
            the only knowledge about programming being from a few free online
            classes my cousin had sent me. After getting through some
            excersises, I decided to enroll in a six month Coding Bootcamp
            through Bloomtech Academy. The course was tough with so much new
            information coming in, but I was able to form a solid workgroup with
            a few of my classmates and pushed through! I learned a ton from the
            course! Not only did I learn how to build websites, but I also
            learned valuable skills such as how to use the web as a resource to
            find answers to any blockers, and how to get comfortable with
            reaching out for help if there was ever any trouble finding an
            answer on my own.
          </p>

            Outside of programming, I have a 6 year old daughter in her first
            year of Elementary school! I love staying active, with Golf being my
            main hobby. I am a HUGE boardgame fan! My favorite boardgame at the
            moment is Settlers of Catan. I also enjoy playing story mode video
            games, as well as watching movies in my down time; my favorites
            being anything Star Wars related, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry
            Potter!
